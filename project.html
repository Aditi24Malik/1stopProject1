                This movie ranking project is a simple HTML-based webpage showcasing a list of favorite movies ranked by personal preference. 
                The page includes headings and descriptive paragraphs for each film, creating a visually organized display. 
                The primary focus is on presenting a list format, allowing the author to share opinions and brief descriptions for each movie. 
                It is an introductory exercise in web development, aimed at practicing semantic HTML and content organization.

                This birthday invitation project is a fun and visually engaging web page created using HTML. 
                It features a headline announcing the birthday celebration, details of the event date (24th June), 
                and an image of a birthday cake to set a festive tone. 
                The invite includes a checklist of items guests should bring—balloons, cake, 
                and an appetite—as well as an embedded link to a Google Maps location for easy navigation to the party venue. 
                The project demonstrates simple web development skills, combining basic elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, 
                images, and hyperlinks to create an inviting and informative event page.

                This project is a simple motivational webpage designed to inspire and encourage users. 
                It features a clean, aesthetic design with an embedded motivational image and a powerful message. 
                The HTML structure includes an image with a positive reminder and a motivational quote beneath it. 
                The use of an external CSS file (style.css) ensures that the design elements like layout and typography are styled properly, 
                while the Libre Baskerville font adds a classic touch to the text. 
                This project serves as a quick reminder for self-belief and perseverance, encapsulating the idea that effort and 
                sacrifice are key to achieving one's goals.
